# EnrollBot

This Arduino project allows you to automatically enroll Chromebooks in a Google
Workspace domain by plugging in a USB device and allowing it to drive keyboard
inputs. It's forked from Centipede by Amplified IT.

User beware: Google continuously updates its enrollment UI. You will most
most likely need to test and modify this program every time before using it
to enroll a batch of Chromebooks.
